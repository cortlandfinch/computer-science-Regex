# Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial

As a developer you must be able to write about code just as well as you are able to write code itself and understand the code that you are refactoring. During this tutorial I will explain the use of a regex function, also known as regular expression, which is a specific search pattern defined by a sequence of characters. After a user goes through this tutorial they will be able to understand how to use a Regex function that will match a string containing a United States zip-code. This function could be useful for developers during a form submit or requirement for a user to have an address that is located in the United States and this check would validate that user during their sign up. 
## Summary

The regex that I will be using will be "\d{5}(-\d{4})?", which will check for a United States zip code. This regex is useful for a form submit such as an e-commerce site that only ships to addresses in the United States, any user that is making a purchase would be required to provide their address during which this regex function would match or not match to a United States zip code and alert the user if they may continue. It may also be used for address verification in the United States or other United States employed companies for their employees during the onboarding or background check process.

## Regex Components


### Anchors
The Anchor of a regex function is used - not to match a character that the function is being used for but to start the position of the string that the function is being used to match within the string at the beginning or the end of the function. In this example the anchor of the function "\d" is used before the starting number of both the zip code number strings.
